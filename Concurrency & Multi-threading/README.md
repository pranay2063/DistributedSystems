Thread Safety
Thread local
Locking (Concurrency control) 
  1. Pessimistic locking 
  2. Optimistic locking 

Mutex and Semaphore 
- Mutex is different from semaphore as it has ownership attached to it
- A thread needs to acquire mutex before releasing it 
- Mutex is not binary semaphore
- Mutex is a locking mechanism and semaphore is a signalling mechanism 
- Semaphore are of two types - binary and counting
