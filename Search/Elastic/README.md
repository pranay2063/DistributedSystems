    Index - Collection of similar documents
    Shard - An index can be divided into physical and logical units called shards. Each shard is a lucene index.
    Segment - Each lucene index is divided into smaller units called segments
    Concepts - Sharding, Replication

*How to search or query elasticsearch*

    Elastic Search provides a JSON-style domain-specific language which can be used to execute queries, and is referred as the Query-DSL.
    The search API allows us to execute a search query and get back search hits that match the query. Elastic search will fetch the records at lightning speed because of schema-less table structure.
