## Docker 

A container is a unit of software that encapsulates everything needed to build, ship, and run applications.  

Containers lower deployment time and costs, improve utilization, automate processes, and support next-gen applications (microservices). Major container vendors include Docker, Podman, LXC, and Vagrant. 

Docker is an open platform used for developing, shipping, and running applications as containers. 

Docker containers are not a good fit for applications based on monolithic architecture or applications that require high performance or security. 

Docker architecture consists of the Docker client, the Docker host, and the container registry. 

The Docker host contains objects such as the Dockerfiles, images, containers, networks, storage volumes, and other objects, such as plugins and add-ons. 

Docker uses networks to isolate container communications. 

Docker uses volumes and binds mounts to persist data even after a container stops running. 

Plugins, such as storage plugins, provide the ability to connect to external storage platforms.
