Managed: Those provided to you in the cloud. The provider sets them up for you and they do provisioning, patching, security, etc. in their own data centers for you. You get to configure server count, type, capacity, etc. 

Serverless: Cloud's SaaS. Full solutions provided online for you, i.e. AWS S3. You know there's servers behind them but never see them. You can use serverless applications over managed services. You can also set-up your own non-serverless architecture over managed services in the cloud.

Managed vs Serverless - Managed services is sales wording for cloud services (they "manage" them for you, meaning HW, provisioning, security, patching, compliance, availability, durability, etc. is their responsibility, depending on the service type of course). You can set-up your fleet of servers over a managed service, you see and configure them, and SSH into them to upload your app. Serverless applications are things you can use or set-up in the cloud but can't see or configure the servers so it's a bit like magic.
